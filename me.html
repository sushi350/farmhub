          Climate change is known to be a common issue all around the world.
          Mainly, in Africa, the causes would be deforestation, bad farming
          habits, some human activities and the emission of greenhouse gas. This
          will lead to change in the ecosystem and even extreme weather events.
          The effects of that would be animal extinctions, decrease in
          resources, no stability, drought...etc. We humans need to take action
          to reduce the impact. Lets protect today, the coming generation and
          even after.

        <h4><u> What is FarmBud</u></h4>
        <p class="base">
          Climate change is an issue affecting all parts of the world. Mainly in
          Africa, the main causes would be deforestation, unsuitable
          agricultural practices and increasing industrialization. FARMBUD is an
          application built to benefit both the communication of people and the
          well-being of the environment. How? You may ask.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="how">
        <h4><u>How it works</u></h4>
        <p class="base">
          FARMBUD has a unique way of working. The app studies the weather
          usually existing in a specific environment. Using that information, it
          provides options of plants suitable for that specific environment. To
          make things a little bit more interesting it has a feature that tells
          you some fun facts about a plant and even some ancient myths. Once the
          user has decided on a specific plant of his/her interest, it matches
          with a bunch of other people having the same preference of plants as
          well as botanists who currently have the species available for sale.
          The app will then schedule a time and date for these people to meet
          and work on planting of the seeds.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="purp">
        <h4><u>Purpose of FarmBud</u></h4>
       <p class="base"> As you have read earlier this app is supposed to bring people together
        and contribute to the environment. This will be a more in-depth
        explanation to how it will do so. There are many factors that affect
        climate change. Usually, in the urban areas, deforestation is the
        problem. This app will clearly help increase afforestation for urban
        areas but how about the rural areas? The causes of climate change for
        rural areas are mostly overgrazing, fertilizers and pesticides. FARMBUD
        will not only help in growing plants in urban areas, but it will also
        help in creating awareness which would lead to donations. These
        donations could be used on fertilizers and pesticides that have more
        quality which would mean less risk to climate change.
